# TPESS Network Study 1
This repository contains the files for Study 1 of my PhD dissertation. Deidentified data to replicate the analyses performed in Study 1 are available in ./data.

Under ./scripts you will find the R codes used to wrangle and analyse the data:
- ./scripts/datacleaning.R contains the code used to prepare the raw data for analysis. As the identified raw data will not be provided here, this file is not executable. It, however, should give the reader a sense of what was done to the original data file.
- ./scripts/analysis.R contains the executeable code to perform the main analysis of Study 1.
- ./scripts/supp_study1.Rmd contains the executable code to generate the supplementary material of Study 1.
